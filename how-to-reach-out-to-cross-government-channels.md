# How to reach out to cross-government channels about a service community
There are a number of places you can use to find teams and people who should be in your service community. You should do this if you do not know who to contact in order to set one up or if you are already running one but would like to expand its reach.


### Slack

Central and local government, channels like #chat: https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com

Local government: https://localgov.digital

### Communities of practice

For example, designers at digital-service-designers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk and user researchers at digital-user-research@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk

You can find and join other communities of practice here: https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/communities

### What to say to them

> Hello
> 
> I work at X on Z. I am looking for people who are affected by the problem of X in the space of Y. If this sounds relevant to your work, please message me! Iâ€™m considering starting a service community in the space so that we can address these problems together.
